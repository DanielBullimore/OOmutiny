# OOmutiny
OO Javascript frontend
atempting a textbook implementation of OO and encapsulation principle 

 OoMutiny can theoretically stack a combined 17,179,869,180 interrupts(queued procedure calls) over its 4 threads. Which would take aprox.80 days to execute (hardware dependent). Also its an infinite stable loop with  puase plus some interrupts can be infinately repeating interrupts... Thats a lot of pre meditation power combined with an object library able to refrence 184 Quadrillion object instances.

I've assigned 5 hours per week at one hour per day out side my normal 50 hour work week to develop this system.

## Wiki https://github.com/DanielBullimore/OOmutiny/wiki/

12/5/2019 - I published my Coding Standards document on the wiki. I once wrote a 5000 line web app with out a documented structure. It was not easy to follow the code even though I wrote it. Docs = good. https://github.com/DanielBullimore/OOmutiny/wiki/Coding-Standards

13/52019 - I have published my agile development method document. I designed this method to increase coding time and decrease testing and debugging. This document outlines how to follow my development cycle and produce the required testing proof. https://github.com/DanielBullimore/OOmutiny/wiki/D.B.-Test-Driven-Design

6/5/19 - Added Captains Log to wiki to save the read me for importaint news only. https://github.com/DanielBullimore/OOmutiny/wiki/Captans-Log

06/11/2019 - Stage One=[ CORE Feature high level design]-( https://github.com/DanielBullimore/OOmutiny/projects/1 ) finally complete, developemt enters Test Planing stage.
